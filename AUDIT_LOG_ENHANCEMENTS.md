## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive audit log enhancements implemented to provide complete tracking of all system activities.

The `cf7_action_log` table has been updated with new columns:

```sql
- artist_name VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL
- artist_email VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL
- submission_id BIGINT(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 (now allows 0 for system-wide actions)
```

### New Indexes
- `artist_email` - For fast lookup by artist
