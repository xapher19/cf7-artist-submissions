### Portal Access Issues

**‚ùå Login portal page doesn't exist / shows 404 error:**

1. **Flush Rewrite Rules** (Most common fix):
   - Go to WordPress Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Permalinks
   - Click "Save Changes" (don't change anything)
   - Test the portal URL: `yoursite.com/curator-portal/`

2. **Use Admin Debug Tools**:
   - Look for "Curator Portal Debug" in the WordPress admin bar
   - Click "Flush Rewrite Rules" to refresh URL routing
   - Click "Test Portal" to test the portal page

3. **Manual Rewrite Rule Check**:
   - Add `?debug=1` to the portal URL to see debug information
   - Check if query variables are being detected

4. **Plugin Reactivation**:
   - Deactivate CF7 Artist Submissions plugin
   - Reactivate the plugin
   - This will recreate all database tables and rewrite rules

**‚ùå Email button doesn't work / leads to 404:**

1. **Check Email Link Format**:
   - Email should contain: `yoursite.com/curator-portal/[secure-token]`
   - Verify the token is being generated correctly

2. **Token Expiration**:
   - Tokens expire after 2 hours for security
   - Generate a new login link if needed

3. **Email Client Issues**:
   - Some email clients break long URLs or don't make buttons clickable
   - Use the plain text link provided below the button
   - Copy and paste the URL directly into browser

4. **Email Template Testing**:
   - Use "Curator Portal Debug" ‚Üí "Preview Email Template" in admin bar
   - This shows how the email will look in different clients

**‚ùå Email links not clickable:**

1. **Use Fallback Link**:
   - Every email contains a plain text version below the button
   - Copy and paste this link directly into your browser

2. **Email Client Compatibility**:
   - Some corporate email systems strip styling from buttons
   - Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail should show clickable buttons
   - If buttons don't work, use the text link provided

3. **Mobile Email Apps**:
   - Try opening the email in a different email app
   - Desktop email clients often have better link support

**‚ùå Portal gets stuck on "Verifying your access...":**

1. **Check Browser Console for Errors**:
   - Open portal page and press F12
   - Look for JavaScript errors in Console tab
   - Check Network tab for failed AJAX requests to admin-ajax.php

2. **Token Issues**:
   - Tokens expire after 2 hours - generate a new login link
   - Verify URL format: `yoursite.com/curator-portal/[token]/`
   - Not: `yoursite.com/curator-portal/?token=[token]`

3. **AJAX Authentication Problems**:
   - WordPress security nonce may be blocking requests
   - Database connection issues with curator table
   - Plugin conflicts interfering with AJAX calls

4. **Debug the Authentication**:
   - Enable WordPress debug mode in wp-config.php:
     ```php
     define('WP_DEBUG', true);
     define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
     ```
   - Check /wp-content/debug.log for authentication errors

5. **Test AJAX Directly**:
   - Open browser console on portal page
   - Run: `console.log(CF7PortalData)` to verify JS data is loaded
   - Test manual AJAX call to verify endpoint is working
